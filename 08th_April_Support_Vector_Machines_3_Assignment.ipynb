        "Here are some regression metrics that could be used to evaluate the performance of the SVM regression model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is useful when the dataset contains outliers that may affect the performance of other metrics. A lower MAE value indicates better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors. A lower MSE value indicates better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric is similar to MSE but takes the square root of the MSE to make the units of the error metric the same as the target variable. It is useful when the target variable has a specific unit, such as dollars for house prices. A lower RMSE value indicates better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.R-squared (R2): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. R2 can be useful for comparing the performance of different models.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.R-squared adjusted: The R2_adj metric penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictor variables that do not contribute significantly to the model's performance. It is useful for preventing overfitting and providing a more accurate measure of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, MAE, MSE, and RMSE are commonly used regression metrics that are easy to interpret and compare across different models. R2 can also be useful for providing an overall measure of model performance.

        "Why MSE is Better:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Measures Accuracy Directly: MSE tells you exactly how far off your predicted prices are from the actual prices. It calculates the average of the squared differences between them, giving you a clear picture of how well your model is performing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Emphasizes Bigger Mistakes: MSE squares the errors, which means it pays more attention to larger mistakes. In real estate, a big error can lead to significant financial losses, so this feature of MSE is really important.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Helps in Model Improvement: If you want to make your model better, minimizing MSE directly supports that goal. A lower MSE means your predictions are getting closer to the real prices, which is exactly what you want.\n",

        "Why R-squared Might Not Be Enough:\n",

        "1.Focuses on Variance, Not Accuracy: R-squared measures how much of the variation in house prices your model explains. While a high R-squared can look good, it doesn’t guarantee that your predictions are accurate. You could have a high R² but still make big errors in price predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Can Be Misleading: Sometimes, a high R-squared can indicate that the model is overfitting, meaning it’s capturing noise in the training data instead of useful patterns. This can lead to poor performance when you try to use the model on new data.\n",

        "In Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "For predicting house prices accurately, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the way to go. It gives you a straightforward measure of how well your model is doing in terms of making accurate predictions, allowing you to fine-tune and improve your model effectively."

        "\n",
        "1.**Less Affected by Outliers**: MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between your predicted values and the actual values.

This makes it more reliable when outliers are present.\n",

        "When you have built an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel and both the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values are very close, it is generally a good practice to prefer RMSE over MSE. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.**Same Units as the Target Variable**: RMSE is the square root of MSE, so it has the same units as the target variable. This makes it more interpretable because it directly represents the typical error in the same units as the predictions and actual values. In contrast, MSE is in squared units, which can be less intuitive to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Error Magnitude**: RMSE penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones due to the square root operation. This means that RMSE gives relatively more weight to larger errors, which can be important in certain applications. If you want to ensure that the model is not making significantly large errors, RMSE is a better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.**Mathematical Properties**: RMSE has some mathematical advantages, such as being more sensitive to the variations in prediction errors compared to MSE. This can be useful for assessing the model's performance in capturing the variability in the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, both MSE and RMSE provide similar information about the model's performance, and the choice between them might not significantly impact your understanding of the model's quality. Therefore, if the values of MSE and RMSE are very close, it is reasonable to choose RMSE for its interpretability and the slight additional emphasis on larger errors."
